# fractals-by-python-turtle
Draw three kinds of fractals by using Python turtle: Koch fractal, Koch snowflakes, Sierpinski triangle.

Drawing Sierpinski triangle by python thurtle was a mini project while I was taking Udacity's Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree.  After knowing how to do it, I summarized my learning here.
